# Benchmarking CE-Symm 2.2, SymD 1.6, AnAnaS, EncoMPASS and BioJava/PDB
---

To benchmark the algorithms, download the MemSTATS dataset and pdb files, the scripts in this folder, as well as 
the raw output of the symmetry-detection algorithms stored on [Zenodo] and using Python 3.5, run:

> python benchmarking_with_MemSTATS.py

Results are written in the **results/** subfolder.
